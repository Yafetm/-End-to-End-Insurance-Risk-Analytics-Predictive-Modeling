**Date**: 11 June - 17 June 2025 
 
## Overview 
This repository contains the code and analysis for the 10 Academy Week 3 challenge focused on insurance risk analytics and predictive modeling for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS). The goal is to analyze historical car insurance claim data to identify low-risk segments, optimize premiums, and enhance marketing strategies. 
 
## Objectives 
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in risk and profitability. 
- Conduct A/B hypothesis testing to validate risk drivers. 
- Build predictive models for claim severity and premium optimization. 
- Implement Data Version Control (DVC) for reproducible pipelines. 
 
## Repository Structure 
- `task-1/`: EDA scripts and visualizations. 
- `data/`: Placeholder for datasets (tracked with DVC in later tasks). 
- `reports/`: Interim and final reports. 
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
